## Overview

This project focused on analyzing the performance of a YouTube channel using analytics data. The goal was to uncover trends in views, impressions, subscriber growth, and revenue while also identifying the best strategies for publishing content. To achieve this, I designed and developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau that enables stakeholders to explore key performance metrics and make data-driven publishing decisions.By leveraging **Excel** and **Tableau**, the dashboard transforms raw data into meaningful insights that guide content strategy and optimize performance.

## Dashboard Features

1. *KPI Overview (Top Cards)* - Displays total Impressions, Views, YouTube Premium Views, Subscribers, Likes, Dislikes, Comments, and Shares. This also provides an instant snapshot of overall channel health.
2. *Trend Analysis (Line Chart)* - Yearly views trend showing channel growth and decline over time. It highlights the impact of publishing frequency on long-term viewership.
3. *Video Lifecycle Analysis (Bar + Line Chart)* - Median Impressions segmented by inactive days (0â€“7, 8â€“30, 31â€“90, 181â€“365), combined with frequency of videos per tier to reveal how engagement decays over time.
4. *Publishing Strategy (Heatmap)* - These are the best days of the week and months of the year to publish videos. Normalized by average views to prevent bias from months with higher upload volume.
5. *Revenue Insights (Pie Chart & KPIs)* - Shows the distribution of revenue streams (AdSense, Transactions, YouTube Ads, etc.) and KPI cards comparing impressions and revenue of selected videos (video-to-video comparison).

### The final dashboard allows content creators and channel managers to:
1. Track overall channel performance.
2. Optimize publishing schedules based on data.
3. Understand the video lifecycle and focus on strategies that maximize impressions in the critical first 30 days.
4. Monitor revenue sources and identify opportunities to grow income streams.

## Insights
With this dashboard, you can:
- Identify the **optimal publishing frequency** to maximize impressions.  
- Understand how **video performance** changes based on upload timing.  
- Track **engagement trends** to improve video content strategy.  
- Compare **subscriber growth/loss** across videos.  
- Pinpoint which types of content drive **higher watch time and revenue**.

**What I discovered were:**
1. Channel views peaked in 2018â€“2019 and showed decline in recent years, partly due to reduced publishing frequency.
2. Most reach occurs within the first 30 days after publishing, but very few videos sustain traction beyond 90 days.
3. Publishing performance varies by day of week and month; certain weekdays (e.g., Wednesday, Friday) showed consistently higher engagement.
4. Revenue sources are diversified, but YouTube Ads and Watch Page Ads contribute the largest share.
